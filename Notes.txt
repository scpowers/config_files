Other software to install:
VcXsrv (XLaunch) for displaying plots from the Ubuntu (WSL) command line
	need to update .bashrc:
	# update local display for plotting in command line
	export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0

	# try to suppress warning
	export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/runtime-scpowers
	export RUNLEVEL=3

To actually get Vundle working, you have to clone from the repository via curl
	and then run something like :VundleInstall.
	Should then be able to run :PluginInstall to install plugins
	from the .vimrc file

Check out the YCM documentation to get it properly installed/compiled:

Make sure you run the install.py file with /usr/local/bin/pytho3 or /usr/bin/python3, it won't work with conda python versions. Also make sure you have xcode and command line tools installed, along with macvim.
