Other software to install:
VcXsrv (XLaunch) for displaying plots from the Ubuntu (WSL) command line
	need to update .bashrc:
	# update local display for plotting in command line
	export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0

	# try to suppress warning
	export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/runtime-scpowers
	export RUNLEVEL=3

To actually get Vundle working, you have to clone from the repository via curl
	and then run something like :VundleInstall.
	Should then be able to run :PluginInstall to install plugins
	from the .vimrc file

Be careful when copying over the .tmux.conf file...if it says you have
	syntax errors, just rename it to some test_file.txt, start a fresh
	.tmux.conf file, and add one line at a time.

Check out the YCM documentation to get it properly installed/compiled:
